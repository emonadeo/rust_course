# Loops and Vectors

## Recap

1. We programmed a basic guessing game
2. `if` and `else` clauses
3. Conveting a `String` to a numeric type (e.g. `i32`, `f32`) using `parse()`
4. Boolean operators

## Kontrollstrukturen: `while`

A `while` clause behaves very similar to an `if` clause.
It checks a condition and executes or skips a block of code, depending on whether the condition evaluates to `true` or `false` respectively.
However unlike an `if` clause, which executes the block of code only once, the `while` clause may execute the block of code multiple times or indefinitely.
When the computer reaches the end of a `while` clause (marked by a closing curly brace `}`), it checks the condition again and jumps back to the start if it is `true`.

Let `a` be a boolean.

```rust
while a {
    println!("Repeat this!");
}
```

### Example 1

Let's use a `while` loop to repeat something `5` times.
We can accomplish this by creating a counting variable `i` with the initial value of `0`.

```rust
let mut i: i32 = 0;
while i < 5 {
    println!("Hello World!");
    i += 1;
}
println!("i = {}", i);
```

> [!NOTE]
> Remember that variables in Rust are immutable by default, so instead of `let` we need to use `let mut` to mark the variable as mutable.

**Output**

```console
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
i = 5
```

### Example 2

Compare this to an `if` clause with the same condition, which only runs once.
As a result, `i` gets only incremented once.

```rust
let mut i: i32 = 0;
if i < 5 {
    println!("Hello World!");
    i += 1;
}
println!("i = {}", i);
```

**Output**

```console
Hello World!
i = 1
```

## Loop Control using `continue` and `break`

#### `continue`

`continue` statements are exclusively used inside loops. When the program execution reaches a `continue` statement, the program execution immediately jumps back to the start of the loop and reevaluates the loopâ€™s condition. (This is also what happens when the execution reaches the end of the loop.)

```rust
let mut i: i32 = 0;
while i < 5 {
    if i == 2 {
        i += 1;
        continue;
    }
    println!("{}", i);
    i += 1;
}
```

**Output**

```console
0
1
3
4
```

### `break`

Like `continue` statements, `break` statements are used inside loops.
When the execution reaches a break statement, it immediately stops and exits the loop.
Unlike `continue`, the execution does not jump back to beginning of the loop, but instead skips over the rest of the code block and leaves the loop entirely.

```rust
let mut i: i32 = 0;
while i < 5 {
    if i == 2 {
        break;
    }
    println!("{}", i);
    i += 1;
}
```

**Output**

```console
0
1
```

## `loop`

For trivial `while true` loops, we can instead just write `loop`.
The following two code snippets are functionally identical.

```rust
while true {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

```rust
loop {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

`loop` clauses repeat indefinitely and can only be stopped using the `break` statement.
Of course, `continue` also works as expected, to jump back to the start of the loop early.

### Example 3

The following example is identical to [Example 1](#example-1), but uses `loop` and `break` instead of `while`.

```rust
let mut i = 0;
loop {
    if i == 5 {
        break;
    }
    println!("Hello World!");
    i += 1;
}
println!("i = {}", i);
```

**Output**

```console
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
i = 5
```

## Improving our Guessing Game

Currently, the player can only guess a single time before the program terminates, no matter if the number was guessed or not.
However we want the player to keep guessing, until they guess the correct number.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    Start([Start]) --> Initialize([Initialize Game: Set secret number]);
    Initialize --> Guess([Player Guess]);
    Guess --> Check([Check Guess]);
    Check -->|Guess == Secret| EndGame([End Game: Congratulate player]);
    Check -->|Guess != Secret| CheckHigher(Check,if lower or Higher)
    CheckHigher -->|Guess < Secret| TooLow([Hint: Too low]);
    CheckHigher -->|Guess > Secret| TooHigh([Hint: Too high]);
    EndGame;
    TooHigh --> Anchor([ ]);
    TooLow --> Anchor;
    Anchor --> Guess;
```

Modify your existing code from last exercise to allow for this.

## Arrays and Vectors

See [Slides](https://github.com/pfhaupt/progkurs/blob/master/rust-beginner/03%20-%20Arrays%20and%20Vectors/03%20-%20slides.pdf) by [Philippe Felix Haupt](https://github.com/pfhaupt).

## Exercise

Once again, we extend the guessing game.
We now want to store all guesses the user has made in a Vector and print it at the end of the program when the user guesses the correct number.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use `Vec::new()` to create an empty Vector.
>
> ```rust
> // Like this...
> let mut vec: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
> // or this...
> let mut vec = Vec::<i32>::new();
>
> ```

> [!NOTE]
> You can use `push` to append items to an array.
>
> ```rust
> let mut vec: Vec<i32> = Vec::new(); // Create empty vector
> vec.push(5); // Append 5
> println!("{:?}", vec); // [5]
> vec.push(22); // Append 22
> println!("{:?}", vec); // [5, 22]
> ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Usually variables can be printed using `println!("{}", foo)`, however this does not work for variables of any type.
> To print a variable that is a vector, we need to use `println!("{:?}", foo)`.
> The reasons for this are explained later.
