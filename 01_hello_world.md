## Variables and Mutability

Now that everything is set up, we can start to actually write Rust code.

_To be written._

## Basic Data Types

Every value in Rust is of a certain data type, which tells Rust what kind of data is being specified so it knows how to work with that data.
Unlike other programming languages like Python or JavaScript the data type of a value in Rust cannot change.
The lack of ability to change a data type is also called **static typing**, as opposed to **dynamic typing**, where values can change data types at runtime.
As such, Rust is a **statically typed programming language**.

There are two categories of data types:

1. **_Scalar_** data types: Represent a single value
2. **_Compound_** data types: Group multiple values into one type

Today we will only look at scalar data types.
Compound data types will be introduced at a later date.

Rust has four primary scalar types:

1. Integers
2. Floating-Point Numbers
3. Booleans
4. Characters
